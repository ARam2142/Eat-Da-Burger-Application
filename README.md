# Background

Welcome to my burger application. Use this application to add a burger to the main menu. When you feel like your ready for dinner, you can then devour it with the click of a button. This is to be used for restaurants so there is a menu containing a list of all burgers that you add to the "burgers to be eaten" section. There is still more work that I would like to do on it later on.
